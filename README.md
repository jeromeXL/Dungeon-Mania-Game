# Dungeon Mania

For many years, Penguin Pty Ltd (a small software business run by Atilla Brungs) has dominated the native application gaming market with hit games. However in recent years, advancements in web technologies mean that the new generation of consumers don't want to download and run a native application, but instead want to play games online. To adapt to the ever-changing market, Penguin Pty Ltd decided in 2021 to take users back to the 1980s and develop a new game called Dungeonmania, but with a modern twist - designed as a web application.

They hired two teams - one to complete the frontend and one to complete the backend. Together, the teams built an MVP which brought Penguin back to #1 on the charts - but now the users are wanting more! A lull in sales has left only budget for two people rather than the previous five to work on the backend. Whatâ€™s more, the previous engineers left a series of design issues in their implementation.

You and your partner have been hired and have inherited the existing codebase for the Dungeonmania game. 

In this assignment, you will be working with your partner on the existing codebase in a series of tasks:

Acclimatising yourselves to the codebase, analysing the existing code, including Design Patterns present and smells;

Refactoring the code to improve the quality of the design, incorporating Design Patterns discussed in the course;

Extending on the existing codebase to provide new functionality.
